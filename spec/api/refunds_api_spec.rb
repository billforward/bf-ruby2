  # unit tests for create_refund
  # &lt;p&gt;When creating a refund either the invoice, or invoice payment must be specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating a refund by specifying the invoiceID will refund any un-refunded value up to the full value of the payment. When refunding via the invoicePaymentID the same rules apply. Refunds will be processed by the same payment methods that took the payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refunds can be for a partial amount of the payment. It is possible to create refunds up to the value of the total payment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a payment or invoice is fully refunded, no more refunds can be created. Errors will be returned if the payment is greater than available refund funds.&lt;/p&gt;
